# RSCP2MQTT - Bridge between an E3/DC S10 device and a MQTT broker

This software module connects a S10 home power station from E3/DC with a MQTT broker.

It is based on the RSCP example application from E3/DC and it was developed and tested with a Raspberry Pi and a Linux PC (x86_64).

Using the RSCP interface of the S10 device, it fetches the following data from the S10 and publishes it to the MQTT broker.

Only modified values will be published.

At midnight, a summary of the previous day's values is sent out:

- e3dc/yesterday/autarky
- e3dc/yesterday/battery/energy/charge
- e3dc/yesterday/battery/energy/discharge
- e3dc/yesterday/battery/soc
- e3dc/yesterday/consumed
- e3dc/yesterday/grid/energy/in
- e3dc/yesterday/grid/energy/out
- e3dc/yesterday/home/energy
- e3dc/yesterday/pm_0/energy
- e3dc/yesterday/pm_1/energy
- e3dc/yesterday/solar/energy


\* status is a binary coded information:  
 Bit 0 (1) : Loading of batterie blocked  
 Bit 1 (2) : Unloading of batterie blocked  
 Bit 2 (4) : emergency power available (batterie loaded)  
 Bit 3 (8) : wetherbased loading active: loading is throttled  
 Bit 4 (16): The output power of the energy storage system is regulated  
 Bit 5 (32): Load lock time enabled  
 Bit 6 (64): Unload lock time enabled  

** emergencypowerstatus is an integer:  
 0: emergency power not supported  
 1: emergency power active  
 2: emergency power not active  
 3: emergency power not available  
 4: motor switch is not activated  

## Prerequisite

- A MQTT broker in your environment
- rscp2mqtt needs the library libmosquitto. To install it on a Raspberry Pi enter:

```
sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev
```

## Cloning the Repository

```
sudo apt-get install git # if necessary
git clone https://github.com/pvtom/rscp2mqtt.git
```

## Compilation

```
cd rscp2mqtt
make
```

## Installation

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/rscp2mqtt
sudo chown pi:pi /opt/rscp2mqtt/
```
Adjust user and group (pi:pi) if you use another user.

Please copy rscp2mqtt and the config file into the directory /opt/rscp2mqtt

```
cp -a rscp2mqtt /opt/rscp2mqtt
cp config.template /opt/rscp2mqtt/.config
```

## Configuration & Test

Please change to the directory /opt/rscp2mqtt and edit .config to adjust to your configuration:

```
cd /opt/rscp2mqtt
nano .config
```

```
// IP address of the E3/DC S10 device
E3DC_IP=192.168.xxx.xxx
// Port of the E3/DC S10 device, default is 5033
E3DC_PORT=5033
// E3/DC account
E3DC_USER=your_e3dc_user
E3DC_PASSWORD=your_e3dc_password
// AES password
E3DC_AES_PASSWORD=your_aes_password
// Target MQTT broker
MQTT_HOST=localhost
// Default port is 1883
MQTT_PORT=1883
// MQTT user / password authentication necessary? Depends on the MQTT broker configuration.
MQTT_AUTH=false
// if true, then enter here
MQTT_USER=
MQTT_PASSWORD=
// MQTT parameters
MQTT_QOS=0
MQTT_RETAIN=false
// Interval requesting the E3/DC S10 device in seconds (1..600)
INTERVAL=1
```

Start the program:

```
./rscp2mqtt
```

If everything works properly, you can see something like this:

```
Connecting...
E3DC system 192.168.178.111:5033 user: <your account>
MQTT broker localhost:1883 qos = 0 retain = false
Fetching data every second.

Request cyclic example data at 2022-01-08 09:59:56 (1641632396)
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/solar/power< payload >2663<
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/battery/power< payload >1953<

MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/grid/power< payload >-45<
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/addon/power< payload >0<
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/coupling/mode< payload >3<
...
```

Check the configuration if the connections are not established.

If you use the Mosquitto tools you can subscribe the topics with (here without user / password)

```
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'e3dc/#' -v
```

Stop rscp2mqtt with Crtl-C and start it in the background.

## Daemon Mode

Start the program in daemon mode:

```
./rscp2mqtt -d
```

If you like to start `rscp2mqtt` during the system start, use `/etc/rc.local`. Add the following line before `exit 0`.

```
(cd /opt/rscp2mqtt ; /usr/bin/sudo -H -u pi /opt/rscp2mqtt/rscp2mqtt -d)
```
Adjust the user (pi) if you use another user.
